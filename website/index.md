# Welcome
Welcome to the Spark Summit 2014 Training hands-on exercises! Much of this material 
is extended and enhanced from those given at previous <a
href="http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu">AMP Camp Big Data Bootcamps</a>.

<img id="intro-components" src="img/spark-components.png"> These hands-on exercises 
will have you walk through examples of how to use the higher-level libraries in the Spark project: 
Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, MLlib, & GraphX.

# Prerequisites

## Assumptions
In order to get the most out of this course, we assume:

 * You have experience using the core Spark APIs 
 * You have a laptop
 * Your laptop has Java 6 or 7 installed
 
If you would like a quick primer on Scala, check out the following doc in the appendix:

 * [Introduction to the Scala Shell](introduction-to-the-scala-shell.html)
